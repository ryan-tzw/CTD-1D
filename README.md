## Possible improvements/new features
- Players can collect items like pants, covered shoes, etc that will help them adhere to the Fablab rules. The objective can then change to collecting all items while successfully dodging the FabLab staff.
- The Fablab staff sprits could increase in size or gain speed as time goes on.
- Players can gain and lose lives so that the game does not end the instant they collide into a staff. 
    - Players could gain lives by answering questions posed by the Fablab staff correctly.
- A highscore could be calculated based on how long the player can last and how many items they can collect before game over.
