CTD-1D Game Project: Fablab Adventures 

Fablab Adventures is a 2 dimensional game made with the Turtle Library. They will use the arrow keys/WASD to move and avoid approaching Fablab staff who will scold the player for violating Fablab rules. Upon colliding with the Fablab staff, the player gets sent out of the Fablab and loses. They will also have to collect items that would help them adhere to the rules. The objective of the game is to collect all items while successfully dodging the FabLab staff.

Libraries used:
- Turtle
- Random 
- Math
- Uuid

Target audience
This game is aimed at Term 1 SUTD students who may not have internalised the Fab Lab safety rules. This is meant to remind students to adhere to the FabLab safety rules in a fun way where students are inclined to play the game when they are bored, have small pockets of time, or find their minds needing some stimulation to stay awake on long school days. A game that is straightforward and easy to play would help the students internalise some of the FabLabâ€™s safety rules.

Fablab Adventure Features 
- Movement
Players move their sprit using WASD or the arrow keys on a keyboard. 

- Random spawning of objects 
Fablab staff randomly spawn at the top of the screen, making it hard for the player to predict where to be to dodge. 

- Collision detection 
If the player collides with the Fablab staff, the game ends and the screen changes to the end screen where the player can choose to restart the game.

Possible improvements/new features
- Players can collect items like pants, covered shoes, etc that will help them adhere to the Fablab rules. The objective can then change to collecting all items while successfully dodging the FabLab staff.
- The Fablab staff sprits could increase in size or gain speed as time goes on.
- Players can gain and lose lives so that the game does not end the instant they collide into a staff. 
    - Players could gain lives by answering questions posed by the Fablab staff correctly.
- A highscore could be calculated based on how long the player can last and how many items they can collect before game over.
